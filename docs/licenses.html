If You<br>   institute patent litigation against any entity (including a<br>   cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work<br>   or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct<br>   or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses<br>   granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate<br>   as of the date such litigation is filed.<br><br>4.

You may reproduce and distribute copies of the<br>   Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without<br>   modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You<br>   meet the following conditions:<br><br>   (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or<br>       Derivative Works a copy of this License; and<br><br>   (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices<br>       stating that You changed the files; and<br><br>   (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works<br>       that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and<br>       attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,<br>       excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of<br>       the Derivative Works; and<br><br>   (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its<br>       distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must<br>       include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained<br>       within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not<br>       pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one<br>       of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed<br>       as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or<br>       documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,<br>       within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and<br>       wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents<br>       of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and<br>       do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution<br>       notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside<br>       or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided<br>       that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed<br>       as modifying the License.<br><br>   You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and<br>   may provide additional or different license terms and conditions<br>   for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or<br>   for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,<br>   reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br>   the conditions stated in this License.<br><br>5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,<br>   any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work<br>   by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of<br>   this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br>   Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify<br>   the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed<br>   with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br><br>6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade<br>   names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,<br>   except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the<br>   origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br><br>7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br>   agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br>   Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,<br>   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br>   implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions<br>   of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br>   PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the<br>   appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any<br>   risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br><br>8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br>   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br>   unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br>   negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br>   liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br>   incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br>   result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br>   Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br>   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br>   other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br>   has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br><br>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br>   the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br>   and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br>   or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br>   License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br>   on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br>   of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br>   defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br>   incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br>   of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br><br>END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br><br>-----</div><div class="c0">@webpack-contrib/cli-utils, webpack-cli, webpack-hot-client, webpack-serve. <br></div><div class="c1">A copy of the

The contents<br>          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and<br>          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution<br>          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside<br>          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided<br>          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed<br>          as modifying the License.<br><br>      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and<br>      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions<br>      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or<br>      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,<br>      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br>      the conditions stated in this License.<br><br>   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,<br>      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work<br>      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of<br>      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br>      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify<br>      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed<br>      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br><br>   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade<br>      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,<br>      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the<br>      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br><br>   7.

Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br>      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br>      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br>      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br>      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br>      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br>      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br>      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br>      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br>      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br>      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br><br>   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br>      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br>      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br>      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br>      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br>      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br>      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br>      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br>      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br>      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br><br>   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br><br>   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.<br><br>      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following<br>      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "{}"<br>      replaced with your own identifying information.

If<br>     the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for<br>     example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to<br>     copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our<br>     licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain<br>     other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of<br>     the licensed material may still be restricted for other<br>     reasons, including because others have copyright or other<br>     rights in the material.

For purposes of this Public License,<br>          simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)<br>          (4) never produces Adapted Material.<br><br>       5. Downstream recipients.<br><br>            a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every<br>               recipient of the Licensed Material automatically<br>               receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the<br>               Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this<br>               Public License.<br><br>            b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose<br>               any additional or different terms or conditions on, or<br>               apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the<br>               Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the<br>               Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed<br>               Material.<br><br>       6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or<br>          may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You<br>          are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected<br>          with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,<br>          the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as<br>          provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).<br><br>  b. Other rights.<br><br>       1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not<br>          licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,<br>          privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to<br>          the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to<br>          assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited<br>          extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed<br>          Rights, but not otherwise.<br><br>       2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this<br>          Public License.<br><br>       3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to<br>          collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed<br>          Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society<br>          under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory<br>          licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly<br>          reserves any right to collect such royalties.<br><br><br>Section 3 -- License Conditions.<br><br>Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the<br>following conditions.<br><br>  a. Attribution.<br><br>       1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified<br>          form), You must:<br><br>            a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor<br>               with the Licensed Material:<br><br>                 i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed<br>                    Material and any others designated to receive<br>                    attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by<br>                    the Licensor (including by pseudonym if<br>                    designated);<br><br>                ii. a copyright notice;<br><br>               iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;<br><br>                iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of<br>                    warranties;<br><br>                 v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the<br>                    extent reasonably practicable;<br><br>            b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and<br>               retain an indication of any previous modifications; and<br><br>            c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this<br>               Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or<br>               hyperlink to, this Public License.<br><br>       2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any<br>          reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in<br>          which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be<br>          reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or<br>          hyperlink to a resource that includes the required<br>          information.<br><br>       3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the<br>          information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent<br>          reasonably practicable.<br><br>       4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's<br>          License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted<br>          Material from complying with this Public License.<br><br><br>Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.<br><br>Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that<br>apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:<br><br>  a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right<br>     to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial<br>     portion of the contents of the database;<br><br>  b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database<br>     contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database<br>     Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database<br>     Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and<br><br>  c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share<br>     all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.<br><br>For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not<br>replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed<br>Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.<br><br><br>Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.<br><br>  a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE<br>     EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS<br>     AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF<br>     ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,<br>     IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,<br>     WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<br>     PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,<br>     ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT<br>     KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT<br>     ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.<br><br>  b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE<br>     TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,<br>     NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,<br>     INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,<br>     COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR<br>     USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN<br>     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR<br>     DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR<br>     IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.<br><br>  c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided<br>     above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent<br>     possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and<br>     waiver of all liability.<br><br><br>Section 6 -- Term and Termination.<br><br>  a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and<br>     Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with<br>     this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License<br>     terminate automatically.<br><br>  b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under<br>     Section 6(a), it reinstates:<br><br>       1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided<br>          it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the<br>          violation; or<br><br>       2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.<br><br>     For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any<br>     right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations<br>     of this Public License.<br><br>  c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the<br>     Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop<br>     distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so<br>     will not terminate this Public License.<br><br>  d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public<br>     License.<br><br><br>Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.<br><br>  a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different<br>     terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.<br><br>  b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the<br>     Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and<br>     independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.<br><br><br>Section 8 -- Interpretation.<br><br>  a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and<br>     shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose<br>     conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully<br>     be made without permission under this Public License.<br><br>  b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is<br>     deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the<br>     minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision<br>     cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License<br>     without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and<br>     conditions.<br><br>  c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no<br>     failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the<br>     Licensor.<br><br>  d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted<br>     as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities<br>     that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal<br>     processes of any jurisdiction or authority.<br><br><br>=======================================================================<br><br>Creative Commons is not a party to its public<br>licenses.

No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the<br>distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.<br>Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a<br>Contributor:<br><br>(a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;<br>    or<br><br>(b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's<br>    modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its<br>    Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor<br>    Version); or<br><br>(c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of<br>    its Contributions.<br><br>This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,<br>or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with<br>the notice requirements in Section 3.4).<br><br>2.4. Subsequent Licenses<br><br>No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to<br>distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this<br>License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if<br>permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).<br><br>2.5. Representation<br><br>Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its<br>Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights<br>to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.<br><br>2.6. Fair Use<br><br>This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under<br>applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other<br>equivalents.<br><br>2.7. Conditions<br><br>Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted<br>in Section 2.1.<br><br>3. Responsibilities<br>-------------------<br><br>3.1. Distribution of Source Form<br><br>All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any<br>Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under<br>the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source<br>Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this<br>License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not<br>attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code<br>Form.<br><br>3.2. Distribution of Executable Form<br><br>If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:<br><br>(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code<br>    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of<br>    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code<br>    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more<br>    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and<br><br>(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this<br>    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the<br>    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter<br>    the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.<br><br>3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work<br><br>You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,<br>provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for<br>the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered<br>Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the<br>Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this<br>License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software<br>under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of<br>the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered<br>Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary<br>License(s).<br><br>3.4. Notices<br><br>You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices<br>(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,<br>or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of<br>the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to<br>the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.<br><br>3.5. Application of Additional Terms<br><br>You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,<br>indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered<br>Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on<br>behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any<br>such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by<br>You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any<br>liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,<br>indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional<br>disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any<br>jurisdiction.<br><br>4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation<br>---------------------------------------------------<br><br>If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this<br>License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to<br>statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with<br>the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)<br>describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must<br>be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered<br>Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute<br>or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a<br>recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.<br><br>5. Termination<br>--------------<br><br>5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically<br>if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become<br>compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular<br>Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such<br>Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an<br>ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the<br>non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have<br>come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular<br>Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor<br>notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the<br>first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License<br>from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after<br>Your receipt of the notice.<br><br>5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent<br>infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,<br>counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version<br>directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to<br>You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section<br>2.1 of this License shall terminate.<br><br>5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all<br>end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which<br>have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License<br>prior to termination shall survive termination.<br><br>************************************************************************<br>*                                                                      *<br>*  6.

Litigation<br>-------------<br><br>Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the<br>courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal<br>place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that<br>jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.<br>Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring<br>cross-claims or counter-claims.<br><br>9. Miscellaneous<br>----------------<br><br>This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject<br>matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be<br>unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent<br>necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides<br>that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter<br>shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.<br><br>10. Versions of the License<br>---------------------------<br><br>10.1. New Versions<br><br>Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section<br>10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or<br>publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a<br>distinguishing version number.<br><br>10.2. Effect of New Versions<br><br>You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version<br>of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software,<br>or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license<br>steward.<br><br>10.3. Modified Versions<br><br>If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to<br>create a new license for such software, you may create and use a<br>modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove<br>any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that<br>such modified license differs from this License).<br><br>10.4.

Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,<br>      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work<br>      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of<br>      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br>      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify<br>      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed<br>      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br><br>   6.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br>      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br>      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br>      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br>      License.
